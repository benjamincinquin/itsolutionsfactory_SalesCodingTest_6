# Benjamin CINQUIN - IT Solutions Factory - Sales Coding Test 6
Technical test from IT Solutions Factory - Work made by Benjamin CINQUIN

## Requirement 
Following tools are required to run these cases : 
 - Java (23 or higher)

## Case 1
Two possibilities to launch case 1 : 
 - From a Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ...), run **ItsfSalesCodingTest6Case1.java** as `Java application`
 - Export **ItsfSalesCodingTest6Case1.java** as `Runnable JAR File` and launch JAR using `java -jar case1.jar`

## Case 2
Two possibilities to launch case 2 : 
 - From a Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ...), run **ItsfSalesCodingTest6Case2.java** as `Java application`
 - Export **ItsfSalesCodingTest6Case2.java** as `Runnable JAR File` and launch JAR using `java -jar case1.jar`

## Case 3
Two possibilities to launch case 3 : 
 - From a Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ...), run **ItsfSalesCodingTest6Case3.java** as `Java application`
 - Export **ItsfSalesCodingTest6Case3.java** as `Runnable JAR File` and launch JAR using `java -jar case1.jar`

*PS : I have a different result on Case 3 because of price calculed for imported box of chocolates. I got 11.80 instead of 11.85 and it looks consistent for me.*

## Unit Tests 

I implemented 4 Unit Tests : 
 - Basic Tax appliance for an exempted product
 - Basic Tax appliance for an taxed product
 - Basic Tax amount
 - Imported Tax amount

To run them, from a Java IDE run **TaxServiceTest.java** as `JUnit Test`.
